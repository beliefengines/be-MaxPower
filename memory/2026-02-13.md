# 2026-02-13 (Evening)

## Key Events
- **PRD Gap Analysis completed** (sub-agent) — ~55% of M1-M4 shipped, 26 gaps identified (3 P0, 10 P1, 8 P2, 5 P3). Report at `docs/PRD_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- **PRD emailed to Ryan as PDF** — converted via browser PDF, sent from Gmail to ryan@beliefengines.io (857KB). Had duplicate attachment issue, removed one before sending.
- **All docs committed to be-MaxPower** — GAP_ANALYSIS.md, PRD_GAP_ANALYSIS.md, SECURITY_AUDIT.md, UI_REBUILD_PLAN.md pushed to `docs/`
- **3 Plane pages created** — PRD Gap Analysis, QA Gap Analysis, Security Audit (with GitHub links)
- **Ryan's new rule:** All reports must go to GitHub OR Plane — no local-only docs
- **PRs #31 and #32 merged** by Ryan (seen in Gmail) — .beads cleanup + unknown speakers filter + Tailwind JIT classes
- **CI failing on main** (commit 232a933) — saw in Gmail, 5 annotation errors
- **No open PRs** as of 7:05pm PST

## Plane Pages Created
- `dac393f4` — PRD Gap Analysis
- `baa4e50e` — QA Gap Analysis  
- `0785f05f` — Security Audit

## Process Learning
- `md-to-pdf` npx tool works but `--dest` flag doesn't exist — just pass the file
- `weasyprint` needs `libgobject` (not available on Mac mini without brew install)
- Best PDF approach: render HTML in browser → `browser pdf` action
- Gmail compose: watch for duplicate compose dialogs opening
- Gmail file upload can create duplicate attachments — check before sending
