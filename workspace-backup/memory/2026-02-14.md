# 2026-02-14 (Fri night session continued)

## PRs Merged Tonight
- **PR #33** — mobile search Tailwind tree-shaking fix (merged ~8pm PST)
- **PR #34** — BeliefCard API alignment, P0 fix (merged ~8pm PST)
- **PR #36** — fix BELIE-62/63/64: search input missing on mobile, FeatureSquares scoped to home, footer always visible (merged ~10:15pm)

## PRs Reviewed & Approved Tonight
- **PR #36** — 3-line fix for mobile search P0. Approved, merged by Ryan.
- **PR #37** — 15 Plane items in one PR: dashed feature square borders, hamburger menu, search history (localStorage), ontology zoom controls + SpeakerPanel on node click, playbook back arrow. 6 files, +202/-63. Approved, waiting merge.

## PR #35 Still Open
- `feat/threads-and-ui-enhancements` — partially reviewed before PR #37 came in. Some overlap with #37 (threads nav, graph controls, search history, SpeakerPanel). May need rebase after #37 merges.

## QA Findings
- **Mobile search completely broken** on live deploy — form element absent from DOM entirely
- Footer form `display:none` on mobile even on search panel (Tailwind tree-shaking)
- FeatureSquares rendering on ALL panels, pushing content below fold
- PR #36 fixed all three issues

## Plane Items Created
- **BELIE-62** (P0) — Search input missing from DOM on mobile (id: `07a29211`)
- **BELIE-63** (P1) — FeatureSquares visible on all panels (id: `d26fec5c`)
- **BELIE-64** (P1) — Footer search hidden on mobile (id: `ea7eec99`)

## Dev Team Status
- Ryan's agents completed ALL 60 todos, zero open items
- Cycle 1 work effectively complete pending PR merges

## PR Monitor Cron
- Running every 5 min, checked repeatedly tonight — working fine
- Only PR #35 remained open most of the evening, then #36 and #37 appeared
