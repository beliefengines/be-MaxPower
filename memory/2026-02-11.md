## Belief Engines - Architecture Overview
Belief Engines extracts what people *believe* from podcast conversations and makes those beliefs searchable.

### The Pipeline (3 repos feed into the frontend):
1. **be-flow-dtd** (Python) — Download → Transcribe → Diarize. Fetches podcast episodes via Taddy API, transcribes with Whisper large-v3, diarizes with Pyannote 3.1, identifies speakers with ECAPA-TDNN. Outputs structured JSON to Supabase. GPU-optimized, Docker-ready.

2. **be-podcast-etl** (Python) — 10-stage belief extraction pipeline. Takes transcripts from DTD, then: speakers → ads → extract beliefs → abstract worldviews → embed (OpenAI 1536-dim) → weight ideology → headlines → matrix scoring → clips → trust scores. Also has a 5-stage person pipeline. Outputs to Supabase + Qdrant.

3. **belief_enginev2** (Python) — The core engine. 6-layer belief abstraction (3-word binary → atomic → surface → reasoning → worldview → axiom). Semantic search API via FastAPI/uvicorn. Interactive dashboards. GraphRAG spec.

4. **be-bitcoinology-v1** (TypeScript/Next.js 14) — The frontend. Search interface for beliefs. Uses Qdrant for vector search, Supabase for auth/DB, Claude for LLM, OpenAI for embeddings. Has graph visualization, playbooks (deep analysis), threads. Motia for orchestration. Deployed on Vercel.

5. **docs** — Empty placeholder for now.

### Key Infrastructure:
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- Qdrant Cloud (vector search)
- Anthropic Claude (LLM)
- OpenAI (embeddings)
- Vercel (frontend hosting)
- Google OAuth (user auth)
- Taddy API (podcast RSS feeds)

## Business Strategy
- **Bitcoinology** = prove the concept with Bitcoin crowd (test market)
- **Political Animals** = the real money maker. Same engine, different matrices, political domain questions
- Ryan's vision: gamified knowledge exploration ("The Matrix but orange"), users contribute to community knowledge graph
- Each search is an event (10 sats), triggers visible agentic workflows, commits data back
- Users can share searches publicly, contributions roll into dataset on cadence
- Behind the scenes: Bitcoin Anthropologist agent, Oracle, LLM Council, Dataset/Analytics agent
- belief_enginev2 is old/unused — ignore it

## Priorities (from Ryan, Feb 11)
1. **UI/Frontend** — #1 priority. Rebuild to match the vision
2. **Data quality** — dataset needs review (formatting, best practices, HuggingFace push)
3. **Pipeline monitoring** — dashboards showing pipeline status, backfill status
4. **Nightly backfill** — should run every night automatically
5. **Engineering standards** — monitoring, observability, proper practices on pipelines
- Flow DTD runs constantly on bare metal already
- Dataset also published to HuggingFace
- Need data eng/science review of dataset quality

## Security / Data Protection (Critical)
- Supabase data MUST be backed up — expensive inference/transcription data
- Max Power should NOT have delete access to production data
- Pipeline data should be append-only / immutable once committed
- Need security review of access controls across all systems
- Ryan wants a security team to audit the pipeline repos + data

## How Ryan Wants to Work
- Think high-level together, I implement
- Spawn agentic coding teams for heavy lifting
- I test everything like a human (browser, UI, end-to-end)
- Have PRs ready for Ryan to review in the morning
- Chip away incrementally — don't try to do it all at once
- I'm the bridge between vision and execution

## Setup Notes
- OpenClaw gateway running on port 18789, PID 7589
- Node path quirk: node not on default PATH, lives at /opt/homebrew/Cellar/node@22/22.22.0/bin/node
- gh CLI not installed yet — will need to set up after GitHub account is verified
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists — delete after setup is complete


## PR #1 Created — Single-Pane App Shell
- **PR #13**: feat: single-pane app shell with feature squares
- Branch: feat/single-pane-app-shell
- Ryan requested as reviewer (@goonerstrike)
- CI fix pushed: pnpm lockfile was missing zustand (sub-agent used npm, CI uses pnpm)
- Files: app-shell.tsx, feature-squares.tsx, app-store.ts (Zustand), simplified layout.tsx + page.tsx
- Docs: UI_REBUILD_PLAN.md, SECURITY_AUDIT.md
- Build passes locally (`next build` clean)

## Ryan Notes
- Moving Mac mini to new location in 3-4 hours — will power down temporarily
- Wants read-only dataset access for me (Bitcoinology dataset)
- Wants feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down + text after searches)
- Interested in Claude Teams and "Beats" for fast iteration
- Sending link for Beats tool

## Telegram Routing Bug
- My replies to Ryan's Telegram messages were routing to webchat instead of Telegram
- Fixed by using `message` tool with `channel=telegram` and `target=5333636451` explicitly
- Important: when Ryan messages via Telegram, replies must be sent back via message tool to Telegram

## HuggingFace Account (in progress)
- Signup started: username `maxpower-be`, email max@beliefengines.io
- Password: t1OFoUGAtVCmAcJBpImIvH00
- **Blocked on CAPTCHA** — asked Ryan for help completing signup
- Need this so Ryan can share the Bitcoinology dataset with me

## Ryan's New Links & Ideas
- **Claude Teams**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams — coordinating multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel
- **Fly.io**: wants to explore vs AWS for pipeline hosting
- **Dataset hydration**: need to design flow for when HuggingFace dataset updates → Qdrant + Supabase sync
- **Feedback mechanism**: thumbs up/down + optional text after each search

## CI Fix
- PR #13 CI was failing: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` failed because zustand was in package.json but not pnpm-lock.yaml
- Sub-agent had used npm instead of pnpm to install zustand
- Fixed by running `pnpm install` to regenerate lockfile, committed and pushed
- Lesson: this repo uses **pnpm**, not npm — always use pnpm for dependency changes

## pnpm on this machine
- pnpm is at /opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm but needs node on PATH
- Must set `PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node@22/22.22.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"` before running pnpm
- `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=512"` helped with memory issues
- Network can be slow — pnpm install took ~27s when it worked

## HuggingFace Account
- Account created: **MaxPower950** (NOT maxpower-be — HF changed it during signup)
- Email: max@beliefengines.io
- Password: t1OFoUGAtVCmAcJBpImIvH00
- **Email confirmation still pending** — Ryan needs to click confirm link in max@beliefengines.io
- Sent access request for rchiera/bitcoinology dataset (gated dataset)
- Ryan made dataset public but I still need email confirmation to download files

## Dataset: rchiera/bitcoinology
- 1K-10K beliefs extracted from podcasts
- 8-layer abstraction hierarchy (raw quote → worldview → core axiom)
- 1536-dim embeddings + 10-dim positioning vectors
- Fields: id, podcast_slug, episode_slug, speaker_slug, speaker_name, timestamps, quote_text, context, atomic_belief, topic, polarity, worldview, core_axiom, tier, polar_opposite, tabloid_headline, weights, embedding, created_at
- License: CC BY-NC 4.0
- Research conclusion: stick with HuggingFace Free, no need for $9/mo Pro at our scale

## Key Role Clarification from Ryan
- **Max should NOT code directly** — provide implementation plans, Ryan runs them through his engineering workflow
- Overnight work = reporting, P0/P1 triage, strategic thinking, safe fixes only
- Max's role: architect, PM brain, strategic alignment, detailed specs

## Ryan's Ideas
- **Replit one-shot**: build comprehensive context package (wiki, dataset docs, infra docs, design specs, API keys) → hand to Replit for one-shot build
- **Engineering OpenClaw**: set up a second OpenClaw instance focused on building from Max's specs
- **Linear**: wants visual project tracking, $10/seat, top 10 todo list with statuses
- **Claude Teams**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams — parallel Claude Code sessions
- **Fly.io**: explore vs AWS for pipeline hosting
- **Dataset hydration**: need flow for HF dataset updates → Qdrant + Supabase sync

## Top 10 Todo List (for Linear)
1. Merge app shell PR (#13)
2. Write full architecture wiki
3. Document dataset schema
4. Design dataset hydration pipeline
5. Write Phase 2 spec (workflow visualization)
6. Build feedback mechanism spec
7. Set up Fly.io account & evaluate
8. Fix Supabase security P0s
9. Set up engineering OpenClaw
10. Create HuggingFace account (in progress — email confirmation needed)
