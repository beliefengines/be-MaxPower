# 2026-02-12 — Daily Notes

## Plane Self-Hosted ✅
- Colima + Plane v1.2.1 on Mac mini, http://localhost:80, 13 containers
- Install dir: `plane-selfhost/plane-app/`
- Tailscale IP: **100.65.89.39** — Ryan accessed "Welcome aboard Plane!" screen

## Fly.io — Unblocked
- Ryan added payment method, CLI still needs `fly auth login`

## PR Review: be-podcast-etl #8 — Ship It
- Concurrent backfill, HF dataset pipeline. No P0 blockers. P1: manifest race at concurrency=15.

## MAJOR: Design Direction Session with Ryan
Ryan laid out the full product vision in detail:

### Everything Is Pixel Art
- NOT just accents — the ENTIRE UI is 8-bit/16-bit NES/SNES style
- References: Punch-Out, Double Dragon, Contra, Final Fantasy
- All text pixelated, all images pixelated, pixel fonts (Press Start 2P, VT323)

### Search Flow
- Loading → retro training animation (Punch-Out jog)
- Complete → LIGHTNING STRIKE (bolt cracks down screen)
- Bolt BECOMES the workflow tree (each branch = agent step)
- Results land as belief card "loot"

### Card System (3 types)
1. **Belief Cards** (orange border) — MINED from podcasts. Face → Expanded (ontology + connections) → Social embed (shareable)
2. **Speaker/Person Cards** (orange) — RPG character sheets with stats, tiered pixel avatars
3. **Community Belief Cards** (teal border) — CRAFTED by users, attach research, community votes (⚡ agrees / ⚔️ challenges)

### Speaker Tier System
- 🟫 Common (1-5 eps, <10K words) — basic 8-bit, gray border, $0/avatar
- 🟦 Rare (6-20 eps, 10K-50K) — detailed, blue glow, ~$0.02
- 🟪 Epic (21-50 eps, 50K-100K) — transformation/armor, purple energy, ~$0.06
- 🟧 Legendary (50+ eps OR 100K+ words) — laser eyes, Bitcoin halo, gold frame, ~$0.10
- Total cost for ~200 speakers: ~$3.20
- Open question: reference photos vs pure AI-imagined avatars (likeness rights)

### Entity Model
- 🃏 Cards = Beliefs, People, Domains (collectible, shareable)
- ⚔️ Arenas/Stages = Events, Episodes (where beliefs happen)
- 🏰 Guilds/Factions = Organizations (teams)

## Artifacts Created
- **15 unified pixel art mockups** in `be-MaxPower/designs/unified/` (all consistent style)
- Cleaned up mixed-style folders → single `unified/` directory
- **DESIGN_DECK.md** v0.2 — consolidated deck with tier table + avatar pipeline
- **DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md** — 75KB, 16 components, full specs + acceptance criteria
- **PRD_BITCOINOLOGY_V2.md** — 103KB master PRD, 7 parts + appendix, clickable TOC
- **AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md** — Oracle, Jackal, Playbook full specs
- **USER_FLOW_MAP.html** — interactive HTML flow map with embedded thumbnails, 20 navigation routes, Mermaid diagram, sticky nav

## Image Generation
- Using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` via `google-genai` SDK
- Also available: nano-banana-pro-preview, imagen-4.0-*, gemini-2.5-flash-image

## Ryan's Preferences (PERMANENT)
- **ALWAYS needs clickable TOC/index at top of long docs** (saved to MEMORY.md)
- Wants everything in one consistent style
- Wants to be able to navigate docs easily, not scroll
- Docs should be organized for engineering handoff with zero miscommunication

## User-Facing Chat Agent
- Ryan wants a persistent chat companion per user (not stateless search)
- Looked at **nanobot** (HKUDS/nanobot) — ultra-lightweight OpenClaw clone, ~4K lines Python
- Could be the orchestrator for user-facing chat threads with long-term memory
- Users return to their chats, agent remembers context/preferences

## THE GATE (Critical Architecture Principle)
- **Every response must be grounded in source material** — podcast transcript or document in dataset
- Agent NEVER fabricates beliefs or attributes opinions without citation
- If no source exists → "I don't have data on that yet" (no hallucination)
- This is the trust differentiator vs generic AI chat
- Oracle agent needs mandatory citation/source check before surfacing any response

## Book Ingestion (Future Feature — PARKED)
- Bitcoin authors who go on podcasts also have published books
- Books should be ingested into the same ETL pipeline → extract beliefs → attribute to author
- Speaker cards get beliefs from BOTH podcast appearances AND published works
- Huge dataset expansion opportunity

## Constitutional Principles
1. **Domain-scoped search** — NOT a general AI chatbot. Queries must be within the dataset domain (Bitcoin for Bitcoinology). Off-topic queries get rejected: "That's not what we do here."
2. **Dual-interface: Humans + Agents** — Platform serves both:
   - Humans: gamified pixel art experience (cards, animations, exploration)
   - Machines/Agents: structured API (belief data, embeddings, citation graphs)
   - Same dataset, two experiences. Knowledge protocol, not just an app.

## Comment System (Anti-Twitter Design)
- Comments on belief cards prioritize people you FOLLOW — shown first, distinct color
- Public/stranger comments below, separate visual treatment
- Incentivizes research: community can challenge bad takes with GATED citations
- "Saylor said the opposite in Ep 312" — sourced, not opinion
- Raises discourse floor, punishes hot takes, rewards actual knowledge

## Agent Org Structure (APPROVED)
- 👑 Ryan — CEO / Vision
- ⚡ Max — Chief of Staff / Architect (coordinates all agents)
- 🎯 Product Agent — PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria
- 🔧 Engineering Agent — code, PRs, builds, deploys (deploying to Fly.io NOW)
- 📊 Analytics Agent (future) — reporting, metrics, pipeline monitoring

## Backup Strategy (APPROVED)
- **Layer 1:** Time Machine → 22TB external drive (Ryan has it, plug in tomorrow)
- **Layer 2:** GitHub → nightly auto-commit of workspace/memory/specs to be-MaxPower
- **Layer 3:** Docker image → portable recovery snapshot on GitHub Container Registry
- **Layer 4:** Backblaze Personal ($9/mo unlimited) → offsite cloud backup
- TODO: Set up Backblaze account, nightly GitHub cron, Docker image

## Tiered Model Progression (Ryan's Epiphany) 🔥
- Users progress through AI model tiers as a GAME MECHANIC
- **Level 1 — Haiku**: Explore, search, gather raw data (cheap)
- **Level 2 — Sonnet**: Structure findings, build knowledge graph (mid-cost)
- **Level 3 — Opus**: THE GATE — thesis verified against all sources, citations checked (expensive)
- Cost = quality filter for Community Card submissions (~$3-5 per thesis)
- Surviving Opus review = legit Community Card minted
- Skin in the game prevents spam/low-quality submissions
- **TODO**: Design different agentic workflows per tier (what tools/capabilities unlock at each level)
- **Monetization**: All costs measured in SATS (Lightning Network micropayments). Pay per search, pay per tier.
- **Splash Page**: Punch-Out style 8-bit tutorial showing rules, tiers, costs in sats. Doc Louis coaching vibe.

## Fly.io Engineering Bot Deploy — IN PROGRESS
- Ryan deploying `beliefengines/engineering-bot` on Fly.io
- Repo was EMPTY — that's why Deploy button was disabled ("Failed to load latest commit")
- I created Dockerfile + fly.toml + README locally, committed, but can't push — need write access
- Ryan needs to add `maxpower-be` as collaborator with Write access to `engineering-bot` repo
- Once pushed: Ryan hits Refresh cache on Fly.io → Deploy
- Config: shared-cpu-1x, 256MB, lax region, port 8080, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set
- Fly.io GitHub app already installed on beliefengines org (all repos access)

## Comms Style Update
- Ryan explicitly asked for MORE emojis 🔥 — thinks in symbols, less text more emotion
- Updated USER.md with this preference

## Ryan's Overnight Expectations
- "Max out the plan" — use Pro Max plan fully, Sonnet for PRs
- Wants to wake up to BIG deliverables
- Data visualizations are URGENT — he needs to see the data to think about product

## Overnight Tasks
- [x] Data visualizations (5 interactive HTML) — sub-agent building now
- [ ] Gate Spec
- [ ] Chat Agent Architecture (nanobot evaluation)
- [ ] Tiered Workflow Design (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus)
- [ ] Book Ingestion Scoping
- [ ] GitHub backup + nightly cron
- [ ] Plane workspace setup
- [ ] Podcast intake criteria research
- [ ] Fly.io — needs retry after Dockerfile fix (or pivot to local/AWS)
